Gorillaz Unofficial Website

## Stage 01
* Looked respectably designed
* A nicely formatted discography
* A link to the forums (open in new window)
* A link to the twitter / A 'latest tweets' panel 
* A couple of other odd links like one to the old site as an archive)

## Stage 02
* Repair the forums
 * Database is huge (almost 2 gigabytes)
 * Getting some strange errors (e.g. when you successfully make a post on some forums it doesn't take you to the 'post completed' screen. 

## Stage 03
* Has a blog (I think wordpress would be fine)
* Integrate the forums and a blog
